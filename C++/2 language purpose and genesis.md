# Language purpose/genesis    

### Why was the language created?
Bjarne Stroustrup created C with Classes to add object-oriented programming into the C language. In 1983, the name of the language was changed from C with Classes to C++.     
### What problems was the language trying to address?
Bjarne included classes, basic inheritance, inlining, default function arguments, and strong type checking to add abstraction to C while maintaining the fast performing low-level system programming of C.
### Is the language a reaction to a previous language or a replacement for another language?
C++ is a layer of abstraction on top of the C language. C++ can be considered as a superset of the C language.
