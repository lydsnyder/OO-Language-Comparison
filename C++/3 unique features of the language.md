# Unique features of the language

### Does the language have any particularly unique features?

* It has an ability to code at the assembly language level if desired, and at a high level of abstraction when desired.

* It has a stronger type system than in C preventing many common programming errors.

* It has a bigger standard library allowing full use of the standard library.

* Its parameterized types using the template keyword allows the programmer to write generic implementations of algorithms.

* It limits the scope of data by using private/public variables.

* It has constructors and destructors for defining default behavior of entities.

* It allows inline functions to increase the execution time of a program. With inline function, the compiler replaces the function call statement with the function code itself reducing function calling overhead.

* It allows overloading of functions and operators. For example, we can overload an operator '+' in a class like String so that we can concatenate two strings by just using +.
