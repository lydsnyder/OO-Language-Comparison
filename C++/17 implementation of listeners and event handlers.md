# Implementation of listeners and event handlers
C++ doesn't natively support listeners and event handling, but some get arounds are..
* Create a multithreaded application and have one thread perform a continuous loop while waiting for a certain event.

* Use a framework that provides them (such as SDL, Qt or GNOME)
