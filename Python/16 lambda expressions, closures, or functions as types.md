# Lambda expressions, closures, or functions as types - [Python](https://github.com/lydsnyder/OO-Language-Comparison/blob/master/Python/contents.md)

The general syntax of a lambda function is:

lambda argument_list: expression

```python
f = lambda x, y : x + y
f(1,1)
outputs: 2
```

In Python, lambda expressions create small functions with no name. Lambda-expressions may only have a single expression for its body.
