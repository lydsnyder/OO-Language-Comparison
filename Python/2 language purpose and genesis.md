# Language purpose/genesis - [Python](https://github.com/lydsnyder/OO-Language-Comparison/blob/master/Python/contents.md)

### Why was the language created?

Python was created because its creator Guido van Rossum had a series of experiences in the workforce that led him to create a language that solved his problems. He had experience with ABC but found its lack of extensibility frustrating. He wanted a scripting language that worked with Amoeba's system calls.

### What problems was the language trying to address?

Rossum was trying to create a scripting language with syntax like ABC that was extensible. He liked ABC, but it was not extensible, and he needed a better way to do system administration than by writing C programs or Bourne shell scripts.

### Is the language a reaction to a previous language or a replacement for another language?

Python took inspiration from ABC and from Modula-3. Guido van Rossum had gripes with ABC, but he also liked many of its features. He drew inspiration from Modula-3 for exceptions.
