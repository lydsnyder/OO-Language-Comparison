# Functional programming - [Python](https://github.com/lydsnyder/OO-Language-Comparison/blob/master/Python/contents.md)


### Does the language support functional programming?

Python does support functional programming. There's an entire section on Python's documentation about how to implement Python with a functional programming style. Python programs written in functional style usually won’t go to the extreme of avoiding all I/O or all assignments; instead, they’ll provide a functional-appearing interface but will use non-functional features internally. For example, the implementation of a function will still use assignments to local variables, but won’t modify global variables or have other side effects.
